# forest-db
`forest-db` is my first attempt at building a database from scratch. I used databases before without fully understanding how they worked, and I didn’t like treating them as a black box. This project is my way of learning and demystifying the internal principles of how databases function by implementing one myself. The initial implementation is inspired by <a href="https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/">db_tutorial</a>, and I’ve gradually extended it by adding my own features.
